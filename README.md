# Computer-Vision-Problems

0. Introduction to Python and OpenCV
   - Understand the Virtual Environment
   - Basics of Image Processing
1. Feature Detection (Corners)
   - Edge, corner detection using Harris Corner Detection
2. Panorama Stitching (Panorama)
   - Feature Detection (ORB Detector)
   - Feature Matching (BFMatcher)
   - Homography
   - RANSAC
   - Stitching ---> (has some errors)
3. Structure from Motion (3D point cloud)
   - Compute relative transformation (Rotation and Translation) using Essential Matrix.
   - Compute 3D scene coordinates (3D point cloud) from a sequence of frames. (Triangulation - Projection Matrix used)
